                        I first created <span style={{color: "#ed6868", fontWeight: "bold"}}>'Hello World'</span> on the web back in 2016, and now an aspiring web developer looking for real world experience.
                        Started with a bootcamp hosted by <span style={{color: "#ed6868", fontWeight: "bold"}}>Devmountain</span> and have proceeded reading and writing code ever since; through
                        other universities and most recently the <span style={{color: "#ed6868", fontWeight: "bold"}}>UofU Bootcamp</span>.
                        While developing in <span style={{color: "#ed6868", fontWeight: "bold"}}>MERN</span> stack <span style={{color: "#ed6868", fontWeight: "bold"}}>(MongoDB, 
                        Express, ReactJS, and Node)</span> creating fullstack websites. Processing data and taking the information to intigrate it into a companies current business model
                        to help generate revenue and give a better experience to their clients and customers is what I am passionate about.
                        I am finding my niche to combine both as I move forward into my career. 
                        My goal is the same the companies goals: to reach the final result that is <span style={{color: "#ed6868", fontWeight: "bold"}}>beyond satisfactory</span>.
